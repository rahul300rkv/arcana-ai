const COMPREHENSIVE_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Is AstroFree genuinely 100% free with no hidden charges?",
    answer:
      "Yes. AstroFree was created on the core philosophy that foundational esoteric wisdom, reflective tarot divination, and Vedic numerology should be accessible to all seekers without financial barriers. Every spread (including the full 10-card Celtic Cross), daily single-card draws, Mulank and Bhagyank calculations, personal year forecasts, and journal logs are completely free to use. You will never be asked for a credit card, payment gateway authorization, or subscription tier.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do AstroFree's AI tarot interpretations work, and are they accurate?",
    answer:
      "AstroFree's interpretation engine combines classical esoteric symbolism with modern artificial intelligence. When you shuffle and draw cards, the deck maintains the authentic mathematical probabilities of traditional 78-card physical tarot decks, including reversed orientations. Our interpretation models analyze the drawn card archetypes, their specific positions within the chosen spread (e.g., roots, challenges, conscious intentions, outcome), and any specific question you share. The resulting guidance is synthesized into grounded, empathetic narrative paragraphs designed for contemplation and clarity, rather than fatalistic or superstitious predictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Mulank (Root Number) and Bhagyank (Destiny Number)?",
    answer:
      "In Vedic Numerology (Ank Shastra), Mulank and Bhagyank represent the two most vital planetary forces in human life. Your Mulank (Root Number) is calculated strictly from the date of the month you were born (reduced to a single digit between 1 and 9). It dictates your inner temperament, conscious thoughts, emotional wiring, and instinctive desires. Your Bhagyank (Destiny Number) is calculated from the complete sum of your birth day, month, and year. It governs your outer life trajectory, karmic lessons, life purpose, and maturity path after age 28-32. While Mulank represents 'who you are,' Bhagyank reflects 'what life demands you become.'",
  },
  {
    question: "Can tarot predict the future with 100% certainty?",
    answer:
      "No ethical tarot reader or reputable system claims that tarot predicts an unchangeable future. Tarot works through symbolic archetypes and psychological synchronicity (a concept extensively documented by Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung). The cards reflect current subconscious patterns, emotional trajectories, and energetic crossroads based on where you stand today. Because human beings possess free will, your conscious choices, actions, and boundaries continually reshape tomorrow. Tarot serves as an illuminating mirror to help you make wiser, more grounded decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my personal data, birth date, and question history kept private?",
    answer:
      "Your privacy is fundamental to our sanctuary design. Your journal entries, reading history, and entered dates of birth are preserved directly in your browser's local storage. AstroFree does not sell or trade user query logs or personal identity details to third-party data brokers. You can clear your journal and saved sessions at any time with a single click in your browser settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Indian languages and scripts does AstroFree support?",
    answer:
      "AstroFree is built to serve seekers across the globe and India with support for 13 languages: English, Hindi (हिन्दी), Hinglish (conversational Hindi in Roman script), Bengali (বাংলা), Telugu (తెలుగు), Marathi (मराठी), Tamil (தமிழ்), Gujarati (ગુજરાતી), Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ), Malayalam (മലയാളം), Punjabi (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ), Odia (ଓଡ଼ିଆ), and Assamese (অসমীয়া). Both tarot spread interpretations and Vedic numerology readings can be viewed in your native tongue.",
